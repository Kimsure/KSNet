# KSNet-for-VSR

Sincerely sorry for the unavailable code that was lost due to a server issue at the university. I'll try to reimplement and release it later this year.

## TODOs

- [x] Build baseline based on [BasicSR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR)   
- [x] Implement kernel split module  
- [x] Implement flow-guided DCN module
- [ ] Clean unrelated code
- [ ] Write clear instructions
